        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an ordinary person who was born and raised ordinary. I've been
          living an ordinary life for the past 25 years, but behind my ordinary
          responses and actions, I have the determination to improve my
          abilities in both knowledge and skills. So, at the start of 2023 I
          started studying at the Open University, majoring in Information
          Systems. After almost five years since I graduated from high school in
          2018, Iâ€™m hoping that studying at the Open University will help me to
          gain more knowledge and insight that will be useful in current and
          future jobs.
